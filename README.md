# slsw-clojure

These are my notes, scratches, and exercises while going through the Clojure section of [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks).

## Setup

I just used homebrew to install clojure and leiningen:

```bash
brew install clojure leiningen
```

## Tests

To run the example code, just use leiningen to run the test suite:

```bash
lein test
```
